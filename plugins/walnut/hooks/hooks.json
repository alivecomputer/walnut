If yes, DENY — log.md entries are immutable once signed. Say: 'log.md is immutable. That entry is signed — add a correction entry instead.' If the edit is prepending NEW content right after the YAML frontmatter, or updating YAML frontmatter fields (last-entry, entry-count, summary), ALLOW. If the file is not log.md, ALLOW immediately."
