<!-- TASKS — The work queue. Updated at every save.

     now.md has next: (the single most important action).
     This file has everything else.

     Markers:
       [ ]  not started
       [~]  in progress
       [x]  done (add completion date)
       @session_id  who added it (lightweight attribution)

     Move completed tasks to Done periodically. Don't let Done
     grow forever — archive batches after 20+ items.
-->

## Urgent
<!-- Time-sensitive. Must happen within 48 hours or consequences. -->

## Active
<!-- Currently being worked on. In progress. -->

## To Do
<!-- Queued. Not started. No immediate deadline. -->

## Blocked
<!-- Can't progress. Waiting on external input, decision, or dependency.
     Note WHAT it's blocked on so the next squirrel knows. -->

## Done
<!-- Recently completed. Keep last 10-20 for context. Archive older. -->
