<!-- LOG — Where it's been. The event spine.

     PREPEND ONLY. Newest entry goes right after this frontmatter.
     Open the file, see what happened last. No scrolling to the bottom.

     Every entry is signed. Wrong entry? Add a correction ABOVE it.
     Never edit history.

     At 50 entries or phase close → chapter. Synthesis moves to
     _core/_chapters/chapter-nn.md. Log continues fresh.

     ENTRY STRUCTURE:
     Every log entry should include:
     - What happened (brief narrative)
     - Decisions made (with rationale — WHY, not just WHAT)
     - Tasks created or completed
     - References captured (if any)
     - Next actions identified

     The log entry is the primary record. A future squirrel should
     be able to reconstruct the session from the log entry alone.
