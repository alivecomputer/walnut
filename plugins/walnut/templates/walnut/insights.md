<!-- INSIGHTS — Standing domain knowledge that persists across sessions.

     Only write here when the conductor confirms something as EVERGREEN.

     YES → insight (write here)
     NO  → decision (write in log.md)

     FORMAT for each insight:
     - [Clear statement of the insight] — [brief rationale: what led to this
       understanding, what evidence supports it] @session_id

     Example:
     - Orbital test windows only available Tue-Thu — ISS scheduling conflicts
       block Mon/Wed/Fri windows. Confirmed by Dr. Voss in Feb 20 call. @2a8c95e9
     - Supplier lead time is 3 weeks minimum — tested with 4 vendors across
       Q1, none delivered under 18 days. @a44d04aa
