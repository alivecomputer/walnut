<!-- INSIGHTS — Standing domain knowledge that persists across sessions.

     Only write here when the conductor confirms something as EVERGREEN.
     The test: will this still be true and useful in 3 months regardless
     of what session you're in?

     YES → insight (write here)
     NO  → decision (write in log.md)

     The squirrel asks before committing:
     ╭─ 🐿️ insight candidate
     │  "Orbital test windows only available Tue-Thu"
     │  Commit as evergreen, or just log it?
     ╰─
