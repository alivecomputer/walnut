<!-- List the people most relevant to this walnut. Each person should
     also have their own walnut in 02_Life/people/ if they matter enough
     to track. Use [[name]] wikilinks to connect them.

     Example:
     - **Ada Chen** — engineering lead, handles all telemetry review. [[ada-chen]]
     - **Dr. Elara Voss** — regulatory advisor, monthly check-ins. [[elara-voss]]
-->

## Context

<!-- Standing context that any new squirrel needs to understand this walnut.
     Not decisions (those go in log.md). Not current state (that's now.md).
     This is the "what is this thing and why does it exist" paragraph.

     Keep it to 3-5 sentences. If you need more, the walnut might need
     sub-walnuts for its component parts.

     Example:
     Nova Station is building the first civilian orbital tourism platform.
     Revenue model: per-seat pricing with group packages. Currently in
     testing phase — first crewed test window March 2026. Partnership with
     SpaceVentures for launch logistics, own engineering team for
     habitat modules.
