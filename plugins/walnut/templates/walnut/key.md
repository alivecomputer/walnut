## Key People

<!-- People most relevant to this walnut. Each person should also have
     their own walnut in 02_Life/people/ if they matter enough to track.

     Use [[name]] wikilinks to connect them. These are searchable markers —
     walnut:find traverses them across walnuts.

     Example:
     - **Ada Chen** — engineering lead, handles all telemetry review. [[ada-chen]]
     - **Dr. Elara Voss** — regulatory advisor, monthly check-ins. [[elara-voss]]
-->

## Context

<!-- Standing context that any new squirrel needs to understand this walnut.
     Not decisions (log.md). Not current state (now.md). Not domain knowledge
     (insights.md). This is "what is this thing and why does it exist."

     Example:
     Nova Station is building the first civilian orbital tourism platform.
     Revenue model: per-seat pricing with group packages. Currently in
     testing phase — first crewed test window March 2026. Partnership with
     SpaceVentures for launch logistics, own engineering team for habitat.

## Connections

<!-- Wikilinks to other walnuts this one relates to.
     Use [[walnut-name]] syntax. These MUST match the links: field in
     frontmatter above. When you add a link here, add it to frontmatter too.

     Example:
     - [[ada-chen]] — engineering lead, also advises on [[glass-cathedral]]
     - [[sovereign-systems]] — parent company
-->

<!-- SUB-WALNUTS: If this walnut has children (folders with their own _core/),
     list them here. Each child's key.md must have parent: [[this-walnut]]
     in its frontmatter.

     Example:
     - content/ — own lifecycle, own team. [[nova-station-content]]
     - engineering/ — own technical context. [[nova-station-engineering]]
