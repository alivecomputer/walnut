## Context

<!-- This is a SNAPSHOT, not an accumulation. Every save rewrites this
     from scratch. If this is growing session over session, you're
     appending when you should be refining.

     Write 2-4 sentences that tell a brand new squirrel exactly where
     things are RIGHT NOW. Not history (that's log.md). Not identity
     (that's key.md). Just: what's happening, what's in progress,
     what's blocked, what's coming next.

     Example:
     Q1 orbital test window confirmed for March 4. Ada's team running
     final telemetry review. Ground control sim needs booking before
     Feb 28. Shielding vendor decision pending Kai's shortlist review.
     Meridian partnership paused until after test window.
