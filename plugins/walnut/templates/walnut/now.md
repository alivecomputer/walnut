## Context

<!-- SYNTHESIS, not a session report. This paragraph should cover the last
     3-5 sessions worth of context — what's been happening, what's in
     progress, what's blocked, what's coming next.

     A new squirrel reads ONLY this file and understands the full current
     situation without touching the log. That's the bar.

     Rewrite from scratch at each save, but DON'T flatten rich context
     from previous sessions. If the last squirrel wrote a detailed
     paragraph covering 3 sessions of work, and this session was a
     5-minute chat — keep the previous context and add to it.

     The test: is the NEW now.md more informative than the old one?
     If not, you're losing context. Keep what was there.

     Example:
     Orbital test window confirmed for March 4 (decided 3 sessions ago).
     Ada's team completed telemetry review yesterday — all systems nominal.
     Ground control sim booked for Feb 28. Shielding vendor decision made
     this session: going with hybrid approach based on Kai's shortlist.
     Meridian partnership paused until after test window. Next milestone
     is the crewed test itself.
