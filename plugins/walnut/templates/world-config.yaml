# World Configuration
# Lives at .claude/world-config.yaml — global settings for the entire ALIVE world.
# NOT per-walnut. Per-walnut overrides go in key.md frontmatter.

# ─── CONTEXT SOURCES ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Where historical context lives. The system knows they're there but
# doesn't load them by default. Searched on demand via walnut:recall
# or walnut:find.
#
# CRITICAL: Every source must specify which walnuts it applies to.
# "all" = safe everywhere. Named walnuts = scoped. This prevents
# the Shopify API being used for the wrong venture.

#
# ─── SCOPING RULES ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
# walnuts: all         → available to every walnut
# walnuts: [list]      → ONLY available when working in these walnuts
#
# When the squirrel opens a walnut, it reads world-config.yaml and
# filters context sources to only those scoped to the current walnut.
# A source scoped to [paper-lantern] is INVISIBLE when working in
# nova-station. This prevents cross-contamination.
#
# ─── SOURCE TYPES ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# mcp_live       — live API via MCP integration (no archive needed)
# sync_script    — synced via custom script
# *_export       — one-time or periodic export from platform
# *_archive      — bulk archive of historical content
# markdown_vault — existing markdown folder (Obsidian, etc.)
#
# ─── INDEXING ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# When indexed: true, the system has built a lightweight index at
# _references/archives/[source]-index.md listing items by date,
# topic, and participants. The squirrel reads the index to know
# what exists without loading the full archive.
