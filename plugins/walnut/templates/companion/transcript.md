<!-- COMPANION — Detailed enough you rarely need the raw file. -->

## Summary
<!-- 3-5 sentences. What was this call/meeting about? What was the
     energy? What was the outcome? -->

## Key Decisions
<!-- Decisions made during the conversation. Include who decided and
     any rationale discussed. These should also be stashed for routing. -->

## Action Items
<!-- Tasks assigned or committed to. Who owns each one. Deadlines if
     mentioned. These should also be stashed for routing. -->

## Key Quotes
<!-- Verbatim quotes worth preserving. The things people said that
     capture insight, direction, or commitment. Attribute each. -->

## People Mentioned
<!-- Anyone referenced who isn't a participant. Note context —
     "Kai mentioned as potential shielding vendor contact." -->

## Open Questions
<!-- Things raised but not resolved. Questions that need follow-up. -->
