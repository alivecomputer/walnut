## Synthesis
<!-- The squirrel's structured summary of what was found. Not raw search
     results — processed knowledge. What did we learn? What's the answer? -->

## Key Findings
<!-- Specific facts, data points, comparisons discovered. The stuff
     that would take 30 minutes to rediscover. -->

## Sources Consulted
<!-- Where the information came from. URLs, documents, APIs, databases.
     Enough to verify or go deeper. -->

## Open Questions
<!-- What wasn't resolved. What needs more investigation. What was
     ambiguous or contradictory across sources. -->

## Implications
<!-- How does this research affect decisions? What should change based
     on what we found? -->
