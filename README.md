## What is a Walnut?

Three files:

| File | What it holds |
|------|--------------|
| `key.md` | What it is — people, specs, evergreen |
| `now.md` | Where it is — phase, next action, tasks |
| `log.md` | Where it's been — signed entries |

Any type can be a Walnut: venture, person, campaign, experiment, life area, project.
